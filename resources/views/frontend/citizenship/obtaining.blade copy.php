All of these reasons make obtaining Turkish citizenship and a Turkish passport a dream for many, as it provides its holders with economic, social, health, and educational benefits guaranteed by the government for its citizens, in addition to all the facilities provided by the government that enable industrialists and businessmen to benefit from Turkey's economic growth.
